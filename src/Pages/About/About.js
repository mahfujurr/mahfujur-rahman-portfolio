                    Hey! I'm MD Mahfujur Rahman, I've been close to a computer since an early age, and been passionate about it ever since.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I really liked to build stuff using no-code tools
                    back in 2016, and from that, I explored how to code myself, fast-forward to today, I do programming in various languages and technologies.
                    I'm interested in building something awesome with code and automate tasks with code, currently focused on Web Development,

                    <br />
                    <span>
                        When I'm not coding I play games with my friends, watch some show, or if the weather's good then go out for a walk!
                    </span>
                </p>
            </div>
            
        </div>
    );
};
